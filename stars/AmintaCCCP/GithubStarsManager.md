## ✨ Features

Tired of starring everything and finding nothing? GitHub Stars Manager automatically syncs your starred repos, uses AI to summarize and categorize them, and lets you find anything with semantic search. Track releases, filter assets, and one‑click download—smarter than manual tags, simpler than GitHub.

- Auto-sync stars: connect your GitHub token to pull all starred repos
- AI summaries & categories: generate tags, topics, and short README overviews
- Semantic search: find repos by intent, not exact names
- Release tracking: subscribe to repos and see new versions in one place
- One‑click downloads: expand release assets and download instantly
- Smart filters: match assets by keywords (e.g., dmg/mac/arm64/aarch64)
- Bilingual wiki jump: deepwiki (EN) or zread (ZH) based on language
- Packaged client: no environment setup required

### Starred Repo Manager

1. Automatically pull the starred repositories under your github account. You can use AI to automatically analyze the repository and automatically generate repository descriptions, labels, and classifications.
2. through the filter, keyword search, you can quickly find the repository.

## 👋🏻 How to Use

### 💻 Desktop Client (Recommended)

You can download desktop client here:
https://github.com/AmintaCCCP/GithubStarsManager/releases

### 🤖 Run With code

1. Download the source code, or clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory, and open a Terminal window at the downloaded folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to build

> 💡 When running the project locally using `npm run dev`, calls to AI services and WebDAV may fail due to CORS restrictions. To avoid this issue, use the prebuilt client application or build the client yourself.

### 🐳 Run With Docker

You can also run this application using Docker. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions on how to build and deploy using Docker. The Docker setup handles CORS properly and allows you to configure any AI or WebDAV service URLs directly in the application.


## Who it’s for

Developers with hundreds/thousands of stars
People who systematically track releases
“Lazy-efficient” users who don’t want manual tagging

## Additional Notes

1. There is no backend for this app, so save your important data on your own.
2. I can't write code, this app is entirely written by the AI, mainly for my personal requirment. If you have a new feature or meet a bug, I can only try to do it, but I can't guarantee it, because it depends on the AI to do it successfully.😹
